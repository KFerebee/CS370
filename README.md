Current Emerging Trends

In this project, I developed an intelligent agent—a pirate—tasked with finding treasure using reinforcement learning techniques. I was provided with the environment setup, which defined the agent's possible actions, while I implemented the core components of the agent’s learning process. Specifically, I created and fine-tuned the Q-learning algorithm, defined the reward functions, and adjusted various parameters to help the agent efficiently learn how to reach its goal. Through this work, I demonstrated key concepts of reinforcement learning and deep Q-learning, applying them to a real-world problem and creating an adaptive model capable of learning from its environment.

This project reinforced my understanding of how computer scientists approach and solve complex problems. Computer scientists play a critical role in designing systems and algorithms that solve real-world challenges, directly impacting industries from healthcare to cybersecurity. I learned that problem-solving in computer science is iterative and hands-on—experimenting, analyzing results, and refining code are all essential parts of the process. As I developed the pirate agent, I approached each challenge with a methodical mindset, adjusting strategies and observing outcomes to guide my next steps.

This experience also highlighted the importance of ethical responsibility. It’s essential to prioritize transparency and fairness in AI models, as these technologies often influence real-world decisions. In developing this project, I considered how the agent’s decision-making should be unbiased and reliable, underscoring my commitment to ethical standards. As a computer scientist, my goal is to build models that are not only functional but also responsible, ensuring they protect the end user and reflect the organization’s ethical values. This project will serve as a valuable addition to my portfolio, capturing both my technical skills and my dedication to ethical AI development.
